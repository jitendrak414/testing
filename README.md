### how do I know what to test?

#### ??? Big Question  "How do I know what to test?"
If you are try to writing **web application**
`1. you should test all the pages`
`2. Every User interaction realated to page`
`3. pages are made from code having function and modueles`

`There is 2 things while writing your code`
1. legacy code which comes without tests
2. implement a new functionality

`Some Steps`
1. import the function to test
2. give an input to the function
3. define what to expect as the output
4. check if the function produces the expected output

 `that's it.`
 `Testing won't be scary anymore if you think in these terms: input - expected output - assert the result.`
#### `Now hands on Jest!`
